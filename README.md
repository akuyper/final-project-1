## Overview

The goal of this lab is to learn how to utilize the `readr` package, a member of the `tidyverse`, to load flat files (e.g., `csv` & `txt`) and to gain a better understanding of the basic data structure called a "tibble". Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some of R's older behaviors to make life a little easier by avoiding unintentional mistakes/errors. The `tibble` package, another member of the `tidyverse`, provides the framework for these opinionated data frames which make working with data in the tidyverse possible.

Useful resources:

- [`tibble` package home page](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/index.html).
- [`readr` package home page](http://readr.tidyverse.org/articles/readr.html)

Additionally, you will learn how to ignore files that are too large for version control! 

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L04_data_import.html`. A template is also provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L04.qmd).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
